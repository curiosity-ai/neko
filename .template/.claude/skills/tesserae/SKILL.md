# Tesserae

A `tesserae` fenced block contains C# UI code that Neko compiles and runs at
build time. The output is a tabbed view: source code on one side, an
interactive preview on the other.

## Syntax

````markdown
```tesserae
using Tesserae;
using static Tesserae.UI;

public class TodoApp
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        MountToBody(TextBlock("Hello, Tesserae!"));
    }
}
```
````

## What it expects

- A complete C# program with a `Main` entry point.
- A call into Tesserae's `MountToBody(...)` (or equivalent) at the end so the
  block produces a rendered UI.
- The `Tesserae` and `Tesserae.UI` namespaces — both already on the classpath.

## When to use

- This component is meaningful **only** in projects that embed Tesserae (e.g.
  `Tesserae`'s own docs). Most Neko sites will never use it.
- For C# code with API documentation but no live preview, use
  [`csharp-docs`](../csharp-docs/SKILL.md).
- For arbitrary C# code blocks, use a plain
  [`code-block`](../code-block/SKILL.md) with ` ```csharp `.

## Tips

- Failures in the embedded program become build errors — keep examples
  self-contained and exercise common paths.
- Use small, focused examples; full apps don't fit the inline preview pane.
